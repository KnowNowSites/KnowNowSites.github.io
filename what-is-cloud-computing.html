<h1>What Is Cloud Computing?</h1>

<p>
Cloud computing means using computers and storage that belong to someone else over the internet instead of using your own computer for everything.
</p>

<h2>Simple explanation</h2>

<p>
Instead of installing programs or saving files on your laptop, cloud computing lets you access them online from large data centers.
</p>

<p>
These data centers are owned by companies like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft.
</p>

<h2>Everyday example</h2>

<p>
When you use Gmail, your emails are not stored on your computer.
They are stored on Google’s computers and you access them through the internet.
</p>

<p>
That is cloud computing.
</p>

<h2>Why people use cloud computing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can access your data from anywhere</li>
  <li>You do not need powerful hardware</li>
  <li>Updates and maintenance are handled by the provider</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is cloud computing the internet?</h2>

<p>
No. The internet is the connection.
Cloud computing is what runs on top of that connection.
</p>

<p>
The cloud uses the internet to deliver services, storage, and computing power.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Cloud computing is a way of using remote computers over the internet to store data, run software, and perform tasks without relying on your own device.
