<h1>What Is Computer Hardware?</h1>

<p>
Computer hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that you can see and touch.
</p>

<h2>Examples of computer hardware</h2>

<p>
Common hardware parts include the keyboard, mouse, screen, and the main computer unit.
Inside the computer, hardware also includes components like the processor, memory, and storage.
</p>

<h2>Internal vs external hardware</h2>

<p>
Some hardware parts are inside the computer and work behind the scenes.
Others are outside and allow users to interact with the machine.
</p>

<h2>Why hardware is important</h2>

<p>
Hardware provides the physical foundation that allows software to run.
Without hardware, computer programs would have nothing to operate on.
</p>

<h2>Hardware and wear</h2>

<p>
Because hardware is physical, it can wear out or break over time.
This is different from software, which exists as digital information.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
Computer hardware includes all the physical components that make up a computer and allow it to function.
