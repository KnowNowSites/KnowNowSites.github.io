<h1>What Is an IP Address?</h1>

<p>
An IP address is a number that identifies a device on a network so data knows where to go.
</p>

<h2>What does IP mean?</h2>

<p>
IP stands for Internet Protocol.
It is a set of rules that computers use to send information to each other.
</p>

<h2>Simple example</h2>

<p>
An IP address works like a mailing address.
If you send a letter, the address tells the postal service where to deliver it.
</p>

<p>
On the internet, an IP address tells data which device should receive it.
</p>

<h2>Do all devices have an IP address?</h2>

<p>
Any device connected to a network needs some way to be identified.
This can include phones, computers, and servers.
</p>

<h2>Is an IP address the same as a website?</h2>

<p>
No. Websites use domain names because they are easier to remember.
Behind the scenes, those names are linked to IP addresses.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
An IP address is a numeric identifier that allows devices to find and communicate with each other over a network.
